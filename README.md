# Profile
Hello, Welcome to my profile! 

Here, im currently learning haxe by making a project: Theoyeah Engine

This "engine" is a big modification of Psych Engine, the most popular (at this time) engine for Friday Night Funkin'. You should check it out i guess?

So im learning haxe, but im thinking into learning java and LUA, and maybe C++ so i can use it to make many cool games with....
Teddies! Yeah... i love teddies, and i want to express it using games. Im currently working on a mod called Doudou Funkin'

Oh, and please don't bother me on discord, i don't have discord.

Have a nice day ❤️
